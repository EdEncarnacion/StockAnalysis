This project is intended for research and educational purposes.

The code was executed using the following libraries:
    yfinance ~ 0.1.74
    pandas ~ 1.4.3
    matplotlib ~ 0.1.6

NOTES:
Though in the Jupyter Notebook you can only see the analysis of Tesla you can change the ticker to any company that you want (provided that Yahoo Finance has information on that company).
If you change the ticker, the analysis output will be almost the same as with Tesla, tough you might loose important information on the stock recommendation block since the time period was due to analyze the increase in the value of Tesla stock.
To avoid this you can perform an analysis of the historical behavior of your ticker and change the time periods as you see fit.
